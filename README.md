# FLOW KIT

Standalone system to generate AI videos via Google Flow. Uses a Chrome extension as a browser bridge: it mints reCAPTCHA and runs Flow's batchexecute RPCs inside a signed-in `flow.google.com` tab, which is the only place they can be signed.

## Showcase

All outputs below were generated end-to-end by this system — from story concept to final YouTube-ready video with thumbnails, narration, and branding.

### Visual Consistency Across Scenes

The reference image system keeps characters consistent across an entire video. Each character is generated once as a reference, then the AI uses that reference in every scene — maintaining the same face, clothing, and features.

**Doctor character** — same face, glasses, white coat across 4 different scenes:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/scene_nk_doctor_surgery.jpg" width="200" alt="Doctor in surgery" />
  <img src="docs/images/scene_nk_doctor_operating.jpg" width="200" alt="Doctor in operating theater" />

  <img src="docs/images/scene_nk_doctor_interview2.jpg" width="200" alt="Doctor interview — smiling" />
</p>

**Defector character** — same face across ICU, hospital, interview, and Seoul streets:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/scene_nk_defector_icu.jpg" width="200" alt="Defector in ICU" />
  <img src="docs/images/scene_nk_defector_hospital.jpg" width="200" alt="Defector in hospital with nurse" />

  <img src="docs/images/scene_nk_defector_seoul.jpg" width="200" alt="Defector walking Seoul streets" />
</p>

<sub>All frames from a single 50-scene project. Both characters maintain consistent appearance across completely different settings and lighting conditions — powered by the reference image system.</sub>

### F-15E Rescue — Full Story Arc (25 scenes)

### What the Pipeline Produces

Each project goes through: **story → entities → reference images → scene images → 8s video clips → narration (TTS) → concat → thumbnails → YouTube upload** — all orchestrated via API or AI agent skills.

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Reference images | One per character/location/prop — maintains visual consistency |
| Scene images | Composed using all referenced entities |
| 8-second video clips | Generated from scene images with camera motion + sound effects |
| 4K upscale | Optional upscale to 4K resolution |
| Narrator TTS | Voice-cloned narration per scene |
| Final video | All clips concatenated, trimmed to narrator timing |
| Thumbnails | YouTube-optimized with text overlays + branding |
| YouTube metadata | SEO-optimized title, description, tags, hashtags |

### Chrome Extension — Live Dashboard

<p align="center">

</p>

<sub>The Chrome extension runs alongside Google Flow — showing real-time request log (614 total, 328 success), video generation progress, and token status. The Python agent communicates with the extension via WebSocket to automate all API calls.</sub>

---

### Web Dashboard — Ops Console

A local React dashboard (`dashboard/`) for monitoring and driving the pipeline — real-time KPIs, per-video stage progress, a scene-level pipeline view with AI review, and a setup guide, all backed by the same FastAPI agent. Supports English, Vietnamese, Hindi, Indonesian, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.

```

Flow signs every call with the session cookie plus a per-page `at` token, and a
generate also carries a single-use reCAPTCHA. None of that can be replayed from
outside the browser, so the agent builds the request and the **page** issues it.
One signed-in Flow tab has to stay open; nothing here works headless.

## Quick Start

### One-command setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This checks and installs: Python 3.10+, pip, ffmpeg, ffprobe, Chrome, creates venv, installs dependencies, verifies imports.

> **Windows:** Use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (`wsl --install`) or Git Bash. All bash scripts and commands assume a Unix shell.

### Manual setup

```bash
# Prerequisites: Python 3.10+, ffmpeg, Chrome
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

```bash
# 1. Load Chrome extension: chrome://extensions → Developer mode → Load unpacked → extension/
# 2. Open https://flow.google.com/ and sign in — leave the tab open
# 3. Create a project in the Flow UI and copy its uuid out of the URL
export FLOW_PROJECT_ID=<that uuid>

# 4. Start agent
source venv/bin/activate   # if using setup.sh
python -m agent.main

# 5. Verify
curl http://127.0.0.1:8100/health
# {"status":"ok","extension_connected":true}
curl http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/flow/status
# {"connected":true,"transport":"batch","flow_project_id":"…","flow_key_present":false}
```

`flow_key_present: false` is expected — the current transport has no bearer
token. Step 3 is not optional: Flow's project-creation endpoint went with the
migration, so without a pinned project every request fails `NO_FLOW_PROJECT`.
You can also pass `flow_project_id` per project on `POST /api/projects`.

### Configuration

| Env var | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `FLOW_PROJECT_ID` | — | The Flow project every RPC is scoped to. Required. |
| `FLOW_ALLOW_DEGRADED` | `0` | `1` lets scene chaining and r2v fall back to plain i2v instead of failing. |
| `DEFAULT_PAYGATE_TIER` | `PAYGATE_TIER_TWO` | Carried for the DB and dashboard; no longer selects a model. |

### Image API

The migrated image path supports Nano Banana Pro, Nano Banana 2 and Nano Banana
2 Lite, all five current aspect ratios, 1-4 outputs, true base-image editing and
native 2K image export. Exact future Flow image model wire ids pass through
without being silently replaced by the default model. See
[`docs/IMAGE_API.md`](docs/IMAGE_API.md).

### Upload images from API callers

External callers should upload bytes instead of passing caller-local filesystem paths. The recommended direct-file endpoint is multipart:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/flow/upload-image-file \
  -F 'file=@./source.jpg;type=image/jpeg'
```

JSON-only clients can use `POST /api/flow/upload-image` with `image_base64`. Base64 costs roughly 33% more request bytes than multipart, but avoids filesystem visibility problems.

`file_path` remains a server-local convenience mode only. The path is opened by the FlowKit service user, so it must be readable and visible inside that service's namespace. In systemd deployments with `PrivateTmp=yes`, a caller's `/tmp/...` is not the same `/tmp` seen by FlowKit. Permission failures return 403; paths invisible in the service namespace return a descriptive 404.

When `project_id` is omitted on the maintained session-project path, the upload uses/creates the current Flow session project.

### What does not work on the new API yet

Three capabilities have no captured payload, so they fail with
`UNSUPPORTED_ON_BATCH_API` rather than quietly producing the wrong thing:

| Capability | Status | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| 4K/1080p upscale (`/fk-pipeline` last step) | unported | none — keep the 1080p render |
| Veo reference-to-video (r2v) | unported | Omni r2v (`model_family=omni_flash`), or `FLOW_ALLOW_DEGRADED=1` → i2v off the first reference |
| Veo start+end-frame chaining (`/fk-gen-chain-videos`) | unported | Omni first+last (`model_family=omni_flash`), or `FLOW_ALLOW_DEGRADED=1` → i2v off the start frame |
| Omni Flash text-to-video | ported | `POST /api/flow/generate-video-omni-text` (4/6/8/10s) |
| Omni Flash frame / first+last / reference modes | ported | `eb1hJf`, `nprQif`, `MZZa6b` — `POST /api/flow/generate-video` with `model_family=omni_flash` |

Restoring one starts with a capture, not a guess: [`docs/CAPTURE.md`](docs/CAPTURE.md).

## End-to-End Example: "Pippip the Fish Merchant"

A chubby cat sells fish at a market. 3 scenes, vertical, Pixar 3D style.

### How it works (read this first)

The system uses **reference images** to keep visuals consistent across scenes. Here's the mental model:

**1. Identify every visual element** that should look the same across scenes:
- Characters → `entity_type: "character"` (portrait reference)
- Places → `entity_type: "location"` (landscape reference)
- Important objects → `entity_type: "visual_asset"` (detail reference)

**2. Describe ONLY appearance** in the entity `description` — this generates the reference image:
- `"Chubby orange tabby cat with blue apron, straw hat"` (what it looks like)

**3. Write scene prompts as ACTION** — reference entities by name, describe what they DO:
- `"Pippip stands behind Fish Stall, arranging fish..."` (what happens)
- NOT: `"A chubby orange tabby cat wearing a blue apron stands behind a wooden stall..."` (don't repeat appearance)

**4. List all entities that appear** in each scene's `character_names` array — their reference images get passed to the AI as visual input, ensuring consistency.

```
Story idea
    ↓
Break into visual elements → characters[] array with entity_type + description
    ↓
Write scene prompts using entity NAMES → character_names lists which refs to use
    ↓
System generates ref image per entity → then composes scenes using those refs
```

### Using Skills (recommended)

Skills handle all the API calls, polling, and verification automatically. Use with Claude Code (`/fk-command`) or follow the recipe in `skills/*.md` for any AI agent.

```
/fk-create-project             ← interactive: asks story, creates entities + scenes
/fk-gen-refs <project_id>      ← generates all reference images, verifies UUIDs
/fk-gen-images <pid> <vid>     ← generates scene images with all refs applied
/fk-gen-videos <pid> <vid>     ← generates videos (2-5 min each, polls automatically)
/fk-concat <vid>               ← downloads + merges into final video
/fk-status <pid>               ← dashboard: what's done, what's next
```

Full pipeline in 5 commands. Each skill pre-checks dependencies (e.g. `/fk-gen-images` verifies all refs exist first).

### Manual API (step by step)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand raw curl commands</summary>

#### Step 1: Create project with reference entities

From the story, identify every visual element that repeats across scenes:

| Element | entity_type | description (appearance only) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Pippip | `character` | Chubby orange tabby cat, big green eyes, blue apron, straw hat |
| Fish Stall | `location` | Rustic wooden stall, thatched roof, ice display |
| Open Market | `location` | Southeast Asian market, colorful awnings, lanterns |
| Golden Fish | `visual_asset` | Golden koi, shimmering scales, magical glow |

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Pippip the Fish Merchant",
    "story": "Pippip is a chubby orange tabby cat who sells fish at a Southeast Asian open market. Scene 1: Morning setup. Scene 2: Staring at the golden fish. Scene 3: Eating the last fish at sunset.",
    "characters": [
      {"name": "Pippip", "entity_type": "character", "description": "Chubby orange tabby cat with big green eyes, blue apron, straw hat. Walks upright. Pixar-style 3D."},
      {"name": "Fish Stall", "entity_type": "location", "description": "Small rustic wooden market stall with thatched bamboo roof, crushed ice display, hanging brass scale."},
      {"name": "Open Market", "entity_type": "location", "description": "Bustling Southeast Asian open-air market with colorful awnings, hanging lanterns, stone walkway."},
      {"name": "Golden Fish", "entity_type": "visual_asset", "description": "Magnificent golden koi fish with shimmering iridescent scales, elegant fins, slight magical glow."}
    ]
  }'
# Save project_id from response
```

#### Step 2: Create video + scenes

Scene prompts reference entities by **name** (not description). `character_names` lists which reference images to apply.

```bash
# Create video
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/videos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "<PID>", "title": "Pippip Episode 1"}'

# Scene 1 (ROOT) — Pippip + Fish Stall + Open Market appear
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "video_id": "<VID>", "display_order": 0,
    "prompt": "Pippip stands behind Fish Stall, arranging fresh fish on ice. Sunrise, golden light in Open Market. Pixar 3D.",
    "character_names": ["Pippip", "Fish Stall", "Open Market"],
    "chain_type": "ROOT"
  }'

# Scene 2 (CONTINUATION) — Golden Fish now appears
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "video_id": "<VID>", "display_order": 1,
    "prompt": "Pippip leans over Fish Stall, staring at Golden Fish on empty ice. Drooling. Open Market dark behind. Pixar 3D.",
    "character_names": ["Pippip", "Fish Stall", "Golden Fish", "Open Market"],
    "chain_type": "CONTINUATION", "parent_scene_id": "<scene-1-id>"
  }'

# Scene 3 (CONTINUATION)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "video_id": "<VID>", "display_order": 2,
    "prompt": "Pippip sits on stool at Fish Stall eating Golden Fish with chopsticks. SOLD OUT sign. Open Market sunset. Pixar 3D.",
    "character_names": ["Pippip", "Fish Stall", "Golden Fish", "Open Market"],
    "chain_type": "CONTINUATION", "parent_scene_id": "<scene-2-id>"
  }'
```

#### Step 3-6: Generate refs → images → videos → concat

```bash
# Step 3: Generate reference images (one per entity, wait for each)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/requests \
  -d '{"type": "GENERATE_CHARACTER_IMAGE", "character_id": "<CID>", "project_id": "<PID>"}'
# Poll: GET /api/requests/<RID> until status=COMPLETED
# Repeat for each entity. Verify all have UUID media_id.

# Step 4: Generate scene images
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/requests \
  -d '{"type": "GENERATE_IMAGE", "scene_id": "<SID>", "project_id": "<PID>", "video_id": "<VID>", "orientation": "VERTICAL"}'
# Worker blocks if any ref is missing media_id

# Step 5: Generate videos (2-5 min each)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/requests \
  -d '{"type": "GENERATE_VIDEO", "scene_id": "<SID>", "project_id": "<PID>", "video_id": "<VID>", "orientation": "VERTICAL"}'

# Step 6: Download + concat
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes?video_id=<VID>"  # get video URLs
# Download each, normalize with ffmpeg, concat
```

</details>

## Core Concepts

### Reference Image System

Every visual element that should stay consistent gets a **reference image** — characters, locations, props. Each reference has a UUID `media_id` used in all scene generations via `imageInputs`.

| Entity Type | Aspect Ratio | Composition |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `character` | Portrait | Full body head-to-toe, front-facing, centered |
| `location` | Landscape | Establishing shot, level horizon, atmospheric |
| `creature` | Portrait | Full body, natural stance, distinctive features |
| `visual_asset` | Portrait | Detailed view, textures, scale reference |

### Scene Prompts = Action Only

Scene prompts describe **what happens**, not character appearance. The reference images maintain visual consistency.

```
DO:   "Pippip juggling fish at Fish Stall, crowd watching in Open Market"
DON'T: "Pippip the chubby orange tabby cat wearing a blue apron juggling..."
```

### Media ID = UUID

All `media_id` values are UUID format (`xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`). Never the base64 `CAMS...` mediaGenerationId.

### Two Prompts per Scene

Each scene has **two separate prompts**:
- `prompt` — describes the **still image** (frame 0): `"Luna steps out of rocket onto candy planet. Wide shot, sunrise."`
- `video_prompt` — describes the **8s video motion** with sub-clip timing and camera directions:

```
0-3s: Wide crane down, Luna steps out of rocket onto Candy Planet Surface. Luna gasps "It's beautiful!"
3-6s: Low angle tracking shot, Luna walks across candy ground, shallow DOF. Luna says "Everything is made of candy."
6-8s: Close-up Luna's face, eyes wide with wonder, golden hour backlight. Silence, ambient wind.
```

### Character Voice

Characters can have a `voice_description` (max ~30 words) for voice consistency:
```json
{"name": "Luna", "entity_type": "character", "description": "Small white cat...", "voice_description": "Soft curious childlike voice with wonder and slight purring"}
```

Voice descriptions are auto-appended to video prompts before generation.

### No Background Music

The worker auto-appends `"No background music. Keep only natural sound effects and ambient sounds."` to all video prompts. Sound effects from the scene (footsteps, splashing, wind) are preserved.

## Pipeline Overview

```
1. Create project      POST /api/projects (with entities + story)
2. Create video        POST /api/videos
3. Create scenes       POST /api/scenes (chain_type: ROOT → CONTINUATION)
4. Gen ref images      POST /api/requests {type: GENERATE_CHARACTER_IMAGE} per entity
   → Wait ALL complete, verify all have UUID media_id
5. Gen scene images    POST /api/requests {type: GENERATE_IMAGE} per scene
   → Wait ALL complete
6. Gen videos          POST /api/requests {type: GENERATE_VIDEO} per scene
   → Wait ALL complete (2-5 min each)
7. (Optional) Upscale  POST /api/requests {type: UPSCALE_VIDEO} (TIER_TWO only)
8. Download + concat   ffmpeg normalize + concat
```

### AI CLI Compatibility (Skill Consumption)

Skills are `.md` recipes any AI coding-assistant CLI can read and follow — this is about **which agent reads the skill files**, not which model does the work:

| CLI | Instructions | How skills work |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded) | Native `/fk-*` slash commands |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` → reads `CLAUDE.md` | User says `/fk-<name>`, agent reads `skills/fk-<name>.md` |

The Gemini CLI target was dropped in v1.3.1 — the CLI is retired, and its
replacement `agy` reads none of what that target generated (see the changelog).
`agy` is still supported, as one of the three CLIs that can run video review —
that is configured in `agent/providers.json`, not by `setup.py`.

### AI Vision Providers (Video Review)

Separate from the table above — this is about **which CLI backend does the vision analysis** for `/fk-review-video`. Three providers are supported and swappable at runtime, no restart required:

| Provider | Binary | Reasoning efforts | Model catalog | Setup |
|----------|--------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| `claude` | Claude Code CLI | `low` `medium` `high` `xhigh` `max` | aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `fable`) or any full model name | Default — works out of the box |
| `agy` | Google Antigravity CLI | `low` `medium` `high` | closed — `agy models` is the whole list and agy rejects anything else | Install separately, sign in once |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI | `low` `medium` `high` `xhigh` `max` (varies per model) | codex's own on-disk cache, plus slugs newer than it | `npm install -g @openai/codex`, then `codex login` once |

Provider, model and effort are set **per role** — a role being a job an AI CLI
does for Flow Kit. There is one today, `video_review`; the config is a map so
the next one is an entry rather than a schema change. Model and effort may both
be `null`, meaning "whatever that CLI defaults to".

**For `agy`, model and effort are mutually exclusive.** Its slugs name their own
effort — `gemini-3.8-flash-low`, `gemini-3.1-pro-high` — so setting both is
rejected (`--model gpt-oss-120b-medium conflicts with --effort=low`), and a slug
with no effort in its name refuses `--effort` outright
(`--effort is not supported for model "claude-sonnet-4-6"`). Pick a model, or
pick an effort and let agy choose the model. The API answers 400 for the pair.

```bash
# View provider status + the current per-role config
#   live=true additionally runs `<binary> --version` on each (a few seconds)
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/providers?live=true" | python3 -m json.tool

# List a provider's models (refresh=true bypasses the 5-minute cache)
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/providers/models?provider=agy" | python3 -m json.tool

# Point a role at a provider/model/effort — hot-reloaded, no server restart
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/providers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roles": {"video_review": {"provider": "claude", "model": "sonnet", "effort": "high"}}}'

# agy takes a model OR an effort, never both — its slugs name their own effort
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/providers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roles": {"video_review": {"provider": "agy", "model": "gemini-3.8-flash-low"}}}'

# The older whole-agent switch still works. It also clears each role's model
# (a slug means nothing to a different CLI) and drops an effort the new
# provider does not have.
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/providers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"active": "agy"}'
```

Or edit it in the dashboard under **Settings**, or run `/fk-change-provider` for
an interactive picker. Full details in `skills/fk-change-provider.md`.

**`codex` needs credits on its OpenAI workspace.** `installed: true` only means
the binary is on PATH; a workspace with no balance fails every review with
`ERROR: Your workspace is out of credits`.

**Contact sheets lose their timestamps on an ffmpeg without `libfreetype`.**
Homebrew's ffmpeg 8.x is one such build: `drawtext` is simply absent, and
naming a filter that does not exist aborts the whole chain. Flow Kit probes for
it once and falls back to untimestamped frames, telling the model the frame
interval instead so it can still answer in time ranges. `ffmpeg -filters | grep
drawtext` shows whether yours has it.

## Video Generation Techniques

| Technique | API Type | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **i2v** | `GENERATE_VIDEO` | Image → video (standard) |
| **i2v_fl** | `GENERATE_VIDEO` + endImage | Start+end frame → smooth scene transitions |
| **r2v** | `GENERATE_VIDEO_REFS` | Reference images → video (intros, dream sequences) |
| **Upscale** | `UPSCALE_VIDEO` | Video → 4K (TIER_TWO only) |

## API Reference

### CRUD Endpoints

| Resource | Create | List | Get | Update | Delete |
|----------|--------|------|-----|--------|--------|
| Project | `POST /api/projects` | `GET /api/projects` | `GET /api/projects/{id}` | `PATCH /api/projects/{id}` | `DELETE /api/projects/{id}` |
| Character | `POST /api/characters` | `GET /api/characters` | `GET /api/characters/{id}` | `PATCH /api/characters/{id}` | `DELETE /api/characters/{id}` |
| Video | `POST /api/videos` | `GET /api/videos?project_id=` | `GET /api/videos/{id}` | `PATCH /api/videos/{id}` | `DELETE /api/videos/{id}` |
| Scene | `POST /api/scenes` | `GET /api/scenes?video_id=` | `GET /api/scenes/{id}` | `PATCH /api/scenes/{id}` | `DELETE /api/scenes/{id}` |
| Request | `POST /api/requests` | `GET /api/requests` | `GET /api/requests/{id}` | `PATCH /api/requests/{id}` | — |

### Special Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /health` | Server + extension status |
| `GET /api/flow/status` | Extension connection details |
| `GET /api/flow/credits` | User credits + tier |
| `GET /api/requests/pending` | Pending request queue |
| `GET /api/projects/{id}/characters` | Entities linked to project |

### Request Types

| Type | Required Fields | Async? | reCAPTCHA? |
|------|----------------|--------|------------|
| `GENERATE_CHARACTER_IMAGE` | character_id, project_id | No | Yes |
| `GENERATE_IMAGE` | scene_id, project_id, video_id, orientation | No | Yes |
| `GENERATE_VIDEO` | scene_id, project_id, video_id, orientation | Yes | Yes |
| `GENERATE_VIDEO_REFS` | scene_id, project_id, video_id, orientation | Yes | Yes |
| `UPSCALE_VIDEO` | scene_id, project_id, video_id, orientation | Yes | Yes |

## Worker Behavior

- **Server handles throttling** — worker enforces max 5 concurrent + 10s cooldown automatically. Use `POST /api/requests/batch` to submit all at once; do NOT manually batch.
- **10s cooldown** between API calls (anti-spam, configurable via `API_COOLDOWN`)
- **Reference blocking** — scene image gen refuses if any referenced entity is missing `media_id`
- **Skip completed** — won't re-generate already-completed assets
- **Cascade clear** — regenerating image auto-resets downstream video + upscale
- **Retry** — failed requests retry up to 5 times
- **UUID enforcement** — extracts UUID from fifeUrl if response doesn't provide it directly
- **Voice context** — auto-appends character `voice_description` to video prompts
- **No background music** — auto-appends "no background music, keep sound effects" to all video prompts
- **Dual video response schema** — Lite/Fast/Ultra models return `operations[]` and stream URLs; Low Priority models (`veo_3_1_*_low_priority`, `*_ultra_relaxed`) return `workflows + media` with the MP4 inline as base64. The SDK auto-detects, validates the `ftyp` magic, and saves the binary to `output/_workflow_videos/{media_id}.mp4`. The scene's `_video_url` is then a `file://` path which `curl` and `ffmpeg` handle natively. `_video_media_id` always stores the real Flow media UUID, so upscale works for both schemas.

### Default Model & Tier Compatibility

The default for `PAYGATE_TIER_TWO` `frame_2_video` and `start_end_frame_2_video` is `veo_3_1_i2v_lite_low_priority` — the TRUE 0-credit Low Priority that works on every service tier including `SERVICE_TIER_ADVANCED`.

The `*_ultra_relaxed` family (Low Priority ultra-quality) silently returns empty operations on `SERVICE_TIER_ADVANCED` accounts because Google requires `SERVICE_TIER_ULTRA` for that path. ULTRA-tier users can switch back via `/fk-change-model` — see `skills/fk-change-model.md` for the full preset list and tier compatibility matrix.

## Material System

Every project must have a `material` field that controls the visual style of generated images. Set it at project creation.

```bash
# List available materials
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/materials

# Set on project
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/projects \
  -d '{"name": "...", "material": "3d_pixar", ...}'
```

Materials control both entity `image_prompt` style and scene `scene_prefix`. Examples: `realistic`, `3d_pixar`, `anime`, `stop_motion`, `minecraft`, `oil_painting`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `API_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | REST API bind address |
| `API_PORT` | `8100` | REST API port |
| `WS_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | WebSocket server bind |
| `WS_PORT` | `9222` | WebSocket server port |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | `5` | Worker poll interval (seconds) |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | `5` | Max retries per request |
| `VIDEO_POLL_TIMEOUT` | `420` | Video gen poll timeout (seconds) |
| `API_COOLDOWN` | `10` | Seconds between API calls (anti-spam) |

## TTS Narration (OmniVoice)

Optional narrator voice for scenes. Uses [OmniVoice](https://github.com/tuannguyenhoangit-droid/OmniVoice) — multilingual zero-shot TTS with voice cloning (600+ languages).

### Setup

See `skills/fk-gen-tts-template.md` for full install guide. Quick version:

```bash
pip install torch==2.8.0 torchaudio==2.8.0   # or +cu128 for NVIDIA
pip install omnivoice
python3 -c "from omnivoice import OmniVoice; print('OK')"
```

If OmniVoice is in a separate venv, point to it:
```bash
export TTS_PYTHON_BIN=/path/to/omnivoice-venv/bin/python3
```

### Workflow

1. **Create voice template** — `/fk-gen-tts-template` — generates an anchor voice WAV
2. **Add narrator text** to scenes — `PATCH /api/scenes/{id}` with `narrator_text`
3. **Generate narration** — `/fk-gen-narrator` — voice-clones the template for each scene
4. **Concat with narration** — `/fk-concat-fit-narrator` — trims scene videos to match TTS duration

CPU-only recommended (MPS produces artifacts). ~15-30s per scene.

## YouTube Upload Pipeline

Automated upload with per-channel rules, SEO optimization, and brand watermarking.

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Place OAuth credentials
cp client_secrets.json youtube/channels/<channel_name>/

# 2. Authenticate (opens browser)
python3 youtube/auth.py <channel_name>              # Linux / Windows (WSL)
arch -arm64 python3 youtube/auth.py <channel_name>  # macOS Apple Silicon

# 3. Token saved to youtube/channels/<channel_name>/token.json (auto-refreshes)
```

### Channel Rules (`channel_rules.json`)

Each channel has a rules file controlling upload scheduling and SEO:

```json
{
  "shorts": {"max_per_day": 3, "optimal_times": ["07:00", "12:00", "17:00"]},
  "long_form": {"max_per_day": 1, "optimal_times": ["19:00"]},
  "scheduling": {"min_gap_hours": 4, "avoid_hours": [0,1,2,3,4,5]},
  "seo": {"niche": "...", "default_tags": [...], "title_max_chars": 65}
}
```

### Skill Chain

```
/fk-youtube-seo    → generates title, description, hashtags, tags
/fk-brand-logo     → applies channel icon watermark
/fk-youtube-upload  → validates rules + uploads (auto-detects Short vs Long-form)
```

Upload validation checks: max per day, min gap between uploads, avoid dead hours. Auto-detects Short (<61s + vertical 9:16) vs Long-form.

## Error Handling

Errors can originate from four layers — Google Flow backend, Chrome extension, FastAPI layer, and the worker itself. The worker's `_handle_failure` (`agent/worker/processor.py:414-481`) routes recovery by **`error_message` string content, not HTTP status**, because Flow lumps many distinct failures under HTTP 400 with varying `details.reason` values.

### Flow-Native Structured Errors

These arrive in the response body as `data.error.details[].reason`. The worker appends the reason to `error_message` as `"<msg> [<reason>]"`.

| Reason string | Meaning | Auto-handling |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| `PUBLIC_ERROR_UNSAFE_GENERATION` | Prompt tripped safety filter (people, violence, nudity) | Mark FAILED — rewrite prompt (use alias names, remove triggers) |
| `PUBLIC_ERROR_USER_QUOTA_REACHED` | Daily credits exhausted | Mark FAILED — wait for reset or upgrade tier |
| `PUBLIC_ERROR_MODEL_ACCESS_DENIED` | Tier mismatch (e.g. TIER_ONE trying Veo 3 / upscale) | Mark FAILED — auto-detect should downgrade to allowed model |
| `Requested entity was not found` | Uploaded `media_id` expired (~1h TTL) | Auto-recover via `_recover_entity_not_found` — re-uploads from `image_url`, re-queues PENDING |
| `Internal error encountered` | Flow backend transient 500 | Exponential backoff retry: `2^retry * 10s`, capped 300s |
| `reCAPTCHA failed` / `captcha` | Extension couldn't solve CAPTCHA | Retry up to 10× without incrementing `retry_count` (processor.py:454-464) |
| `PUBLIC_ERROR_UNUSUAL_ACTIVITY` (403, message `reCAPTCHA evaluation failed`) | Google flagged the session as bot-like — usually rapid bursts of submits, VPN/shared IP, or stale auth cookies | NOT auto-recoverable. Pause submits, clear cookies for `google.com` + `labs.google` in Chrome, sign back in at `flow.google.com`, then resubmit with ≥1s gap and ≤5 concurrent. See `/fk-doctor` for full playbook. |

### HTTP Status Codes

| Status | Source | Meaning | Handling |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| **400** | Flow API | Invalid payload, UNSAFE_GENERATION, entity not found (sometimes) | Route by `details.reason` — some are auto-recoverable, others terminal |
| **401** | Flow API | Should not occur — batchexecute authenticates in the page, not with a bearer | Check the Flow tab is signed in; see `NO_AT_TOKEN` |
| **403** | Extension (`background.js:432`) | `CAPTCHA_FAILED`, `NO_FLOW_TAB`, or `MODEL_ACCESS_DENIED` | CAPTCHA → retry loop; NO_FLOW_TAB → fail (user must open Flow); tier → fail |
| **404** | Flow API | `media_id` not found (expired upload) | Same as "Requested entity was not found" — auto re-upload |
| **429** | Flow API | Rate limited / quota | Back off + retry; if `USER_QUOTA_REACHED` appears, fail |
| **500** | Flow backend **or** extension fetch exception (`background.js:504`) | Transient server error OR network drop during fetch | Retry with exponential backoff |
| **502** | FastAPI default (`agent/api/flow.py:80,92`) | Extension returned error without explicit status | Retry; check extension health |
| **503** | FastAPI (`api/flow.py`) | "Extension not connected" | Worker waits for reconnect — status set to PENDING, not FAILED |
| **504** | Agent | 60s timeout waiting for extension WS response | Treated as transient; re-queue PENDING |

Status-code detection logic lives in `agent/worker/_parsing.py:_is_error` — a result is an error if `result.error` is set, `status >= 400`, **or** `data.error` is present.

### Extension / Transport Errors

String patterns in `error_message` that the worker recognizes:

| Error message contains | Cause | Handling |
|-----------------------|-------|----------|
| `Extension not connected` | Chrome extension offline or WS dropped | 503 returned; worker re-queues PENDING and waits |
| `extension reconnected` / `extension disconnected` | WS bounce mid-request | Re-queue PENDING without incrementing `retry_count` |
| `extension_switched` | User switched Flow tabs mid-generation | Re-queue PENDING |
| `NO_AT_TOKEN` | Flow tab is signed out, on an interstitial, or still booting | Open `flow.google.com`, sign in, let the app load |
| `NO_FLOW_PROJECT` | No Flow project to scope the RPC to | Pin `FLOW_PROJECT_ID` — **terminal, not retried** |
| `UNSUPPORTED_ON_BATCH_API` | Upscale / r2v / chaining — payload never captured | See `docs/CAPTURE.md` — **terminal, not retried** |
| `NO_FLOW_TAB` | No Google Flow tab available for reCAPTCHA | User must open a Flow tab |
| `Failed to fetch` | Network drop inside extension service worker | Retry with backoff |
| `timeout` / WS 60s no response | Extension hung mid-request | Re-queue PENDING |

### Worker Retry Policy

`processor.py:_handle_failure` decides terminal vs retryable:

1. **Auto-recover** if message contains `"not found"` → re-upload media, mark PENDING.
2. **Transient WS** (`reconnected`/`disconnected`/`switched`) → re-queue PENDING, keep `retry_count`.
3. **CAPTCHA** → retry up to 10× without counting toward `MAX_RETRIES`.
4. **Default** → increment `retry_count`; if < `MAX_RETRIES` (5), schedule retry with `2^retry * 10s` backoff (capped 300s). Otherwise mark FAILED.

### YouTube Upload Errors

From `youtube/upload.py` (HTTP errors from YouTube Data API v3):

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `invalidTags` (400) | Tags exceed 500-char limit (incl. quote overhead: spaces → +2 per tag) | Trim tags; validate with `sum(len(t) + (2 if ' ' in t else 0) for t in tags) + (len(tags)-1) <= 500` |
| `invalidCategoryId` (400) | Unknown category | Use `"22"` (People & Blogs) or `"24"` (Entertainment) |
| `quotaExceeded` (403) | Daily 10K quota exhausted (uploads cost 1600) | Wait 24h (Pacific midnight reset) |
| `uploadLimitExceeded` (400) | Channel daily upload cap hit | Wait 24h or use different channel |
| `invalid_grant` (auth) | Token revoked or expired | Re-run `python3 youtube/auth.py <channel>` |
| `scheduledPublishTimeInPast` | `publishAt` <= now | Use `auto_schedule()` or bump to next day |

### Common Symptoms → Fix

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Extension shows "Agent disconnected" | Start `python -m agent.main` |
| Extension shows "No token" | Expected on the batch path — there is no bearer token any more |
| `CAPTCHA_FAILED: NO_FLOW_TAB` | Open a Google Flow tab |
| 403 `MODEL_ACCESS_DENIED` | Tier mismatch — check `/api/flow/credits`, downgrade model in `models.json` |
| 403 `PUBLIC_ERROR_UNUSUAL_ACTIVITY` / `reCAPTCHA evaluation failed` | Pause submits, clear cookies for `google.com` + `labs.google` in Chrome, sign back in, then resubmit with ≥1s gap and ≤5 concurrent. Switch network or wait 1–6 h if still blocked |
| Scene images inconsistent | Check all refs have UUID `media_id` — run `/fk-fix-uuids` |
| `media_id` starts with `CAMS...` | Run `/fk-fix-uuids` to extract UUID from URL |
| Upscale "permission denied" | Requires `PAYGATE_TIER_TWO` account |
| Request stuck in PROCESSING | Check `error_message` history; if extension dropped, restart extension |
| "Requested entity was not found" spam | Image URLs expired — re-upload via `POST /api/upload-image` or wait for auto-recovery |
| YouTube upload `invalidTags` | Tag-char overflow; reduce tags (quote overhead bytes count) |
| Python `cryptography` arch mismatch | Use `python3.10`, not `python3.13` (x86/arm64 binary mismatch) |

## Changelog

Dates are merge dates. Older releases are tagged; `git log` is the full record.

### v1.3.1 — 2026-09-20 — the dead Gemini target

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-20 | **`setup.py --tool gemini` removed.** It generated `.gemini/commands/fk/*.toml` and `GEMINI.md` for a CLI that is retired, and its replacement `agy` reads neither — verified against agy 1.2.7: a project's `.gemini/commands/*.toml` is not expanded, `.claude/commands/*.md` is not either, and `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are all absent from a print-mode run's context even inside a trusted folder. `agy plugin import` imports extensions, not command files. `GEMINI.md` is deleted; `setup.py clean` still removes what the target left on disk, because nothing else ever will. `agy` remains fully supported — as one of the three CLIs that run video review, configured in `agent/providers.json` rather than by `setup.py` |
| 2026-09-20 | **`AGENTS.md` is genuinely generated again.** It says "do not edit" and had been edited anyway: rules 14-16 (fact-check, real-people bypass, review-before-upscale) and pipeline steps 0 and 7.5 lived only in the committed artifact, so `setup.py sync` would have deleted three operational rules. They are in `setup.py` now. The same drift had left the skill table listing 25 skills — missing 11 that exist and naming one that does not; it is rebuilt from `skills/` at generation time |
| 2026-09-20 | `setup.py` gains its first tests (13), including that a `.fk-setup.json` written before this release — which records `"gemini"` — is skipped with a pointer to `clean` instead of crashing the sync |

### v1.3.0 — 2026-09-20 — video review works again

Video review had been failing on every path at once, which is why nothing about
it looked fixable from the symptoms. The unit suite was red on a normal dev
machine for the whole period — 13 of these tests fail on v1.2.0 — while CI
stayed green, because the workflow installs ffmpeg *and* a font and asserts
`drawtext` renders. The one environment that ran the suite was the one
environment where it worked.

All three providers are verified end-to-end against the real CLIs: a synthetic
clip with a planted mid-clip defect, through frame extraction, contact sheets
and a live vision call, with no mocks. claude, agy and codex each find the
defect and score it, on their default model and on an explicitly selected
model + effort.

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-20 | **ffmpeg without `drawtext`**: Homebrew's ffmpeg 8.x is built without `libfreetype`, so the timestamp filter does not exist and naming it aborted the whole chain — frame extraction died before any provider was reached. Probed once, with a fallback to untimestamped frames and a prompt that hands the model the frame interval instead |
| 2026-09-20 | **`agy` was auto-denied**: handed a bare file path, agy reaches for a shell command to look at the file, headless mode cannot prompt for that permission, and the run returns an empty response on a **zero** exit code. Fixed by steering it at its own file-reading tool and naming the sheet directory with `--add-dir`, which gets the read done unprivileged — so `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, which auto-approves every tool including arbitrary shell commands, is gone. Output is parsed from `--output-format json`, and a denied tool is an error whether or not agy still answered — the prompt carries the rubric and both scene prompts, so a denied run can write a plausible review from the text alone |
| 2026-09-20 | **`codex` no longer bypasses its sandbox**: `-i` hands codex the image bytes directly, so the run needs neither a shell nor a writable filesystem. `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` bought nothing and cost the sandbox; `--sandbox read-only` already implies `approval: never`. An empty output file is now an error instead of a JSON decode failure three frames away |
| 2026-09-20 | **A malformed error entry no longer vanishes.** The parser required the exact keys `severity`/`time_range`/`description` and silently dropped anything else — and what it dropped was usually CRITICAL, the one severity that caps `character_consistency` at 3.0 and forces the verdict below acceptable, so `timeRange` instead of `time_range` turned an unusable video into a clean pass. The three fields are now handled by what they can cost: near-miss names are normalised, a missing time range or description is repaired and logged, and only a severity outside `{CRITICAL, HIGH, MINOR}` fails the scene — that is the one field with no safe default, because without it we do not know whether the video passed. `VideoError.severity` is a `Literal` now, so the three code paths that branch on it cannot be handed anything else |
| 2026-09-20 | **A review with no scores in it is now a failure, not a score.** Every dimension defaults to 5.0, so a CLI answer carrying no `dimensions` became a complete, plausible review — 5.0 across the board, verdict "poor", zero errors — of a video nothing had actually looked at |
| 2026-09-20 | **stdin closed for all three CLIs.** Each appends piped stdin to the prompt when stdin is not a terminal — codex documents it as a `<stdin>` block. Under uvicorn that is whatever the launching shell handed down |
| 2026-09-20 | **Per-role provider, model and effort**, editable in the dashboard under Settings or via `PATCH /api/providers`. Efforts are validated against each CLI's real ladder (agy stops at `high`); models are validated only for agy, whose catalog is closed, so a slug newer than claude's or codex's cache still goes through. A whole-agent `{"active": …}` switch clears each role's model and clamps its effort, because neither survives a change of CLI |
| 2026-09-20 | Review hardening from an adversarial pass: one review is pinned to one provider (the role was resolved per scene, so a hand edit or a dashboard poll mid-run could split a video's score across two backends); an unknown agy model is a 400 naming the known slugs instead of a failed review; CLI failures carry stdout as well as stderr (claude puts its readable sentence there); `providers.json` is written atomically (a truncated file hard-fails `config.py` at import, so the server would not boot); and the drawtext probe is an optimisation now — extraction retries untimestamped if the filter is listed but cannot render, which is what an ffmpeg with libfreetype and no font does |
| 2026-09-20 | **agy's model and effort are mutually exclusive** and the config now says so. Its slugs name their own effort (`gemini-3.8-flash-low`), so the pair is rejected — a mismatch conflicts, and a slug with no effort in its name refuses `--effort` at all |

### v1.2.0 — 2026-09-18 — the Flow migration

Flow moved to `flow.google.com` in September 2026 and stopped minting the bearer
token the old REST API needed. Everything below is that migration.

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-18 | `/health` reports the app's real version again — it had been pinned at `0.2.0` since v0.2.0 while the app said `1.1.0`, because only one of the two literals was ever bumped ([#52](../../pull/52)) |
| 2026-09-18 | Omni 1.1 Flash first-frame, first+last and reference modes ported to `batchexecute` ([#48](../../pull/48), [#50](../../pull/50)). Unported capabilities drop from four to three, all on the Veo path |
| 2026-09-17 | REST transport removed — the ten `_legacy_*` methods, the `USE_BATCH_RPC` branches, the fingerprint pools and `agent/services/headers.py`; net −1043 lines ([#49](../../pull/49)) |
| 2026-09-17 | Migrated image API: variant submit, settled-wave retry, and 2K/4K image export via `SPrCad` ([#42](../../pull/42)) |
| 2026-09-15 | Video submit unified across the frame and reference paths ([#46](../../pull/46)) |
| 2026-09-15 | Omni Flash text-to-video on the batch path ([#41](../../pull/41)) |
| 2026-09-15 | Extension: idle-tab leak fixed ([#44](../../pull/44)) |
| 2026-09-07 | `batchexecute` transport added — the agent builds the envelope, the extension signs it inside a signed-in Flow tab ([#39](../../pull/39)) |

### Earlier

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-18 | Omni Flash generation ([#30](../../pull/30)); MV3 flow-key bootstrap ([#24](../../pull/24)) |
| 2026-08-04 | Web dashboard rebuilt with the real pipeline UI, a guide page and i18n |
| 2026-08-04 | Video review: contact sheets split by duration rather than one giant tile; `agy` and `codex` added as review CLI providers |
| 2026-08-04 | Skill files standardised on `fk-<name>` |
| 2026-05-09 | `v1.1.0` |
| 2026-04-27 | `v1.0.2` |
| 2026-04-22 | `v1.0.1` |
