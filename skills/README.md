# Skills — Flow Kit

Workflow skills for AI agents and humans. Each skill is a step-by-step recipe.

## Pipeline (run in order)

| 3 | `fk-gen-images` | [fk-gen-images.md](fk-gen-images.md) | Generate scene images with character refs |
| 4 | `fk-gen-videos` | [fk-gen-videos.md](fk-gen-videos.md) | Generate videos from scene images |
| 5 | `fk-concat` | [fk-concat.md](fk-concat.md) | Download + merge all scene videos |

## Advanced Video

| Skill | File | Description |

| `fk-fix-uuids` | [fk-fix-uuids.md](fk-fix-uuids.md) | Repair any CAMS... media_ids to UUID format |

## Cross-Tool Compatibility

Skills live in `skills/` — the single source of truth. Run `setup.py` to generate configs for your AI tool:

```bash
python setup.py           # Interactive setup
python setup.py --tool all  # Generate for all tools
python setup.py sync      # Re-sync after adding skills
python setup.py clean     # Remove generated configs
```

| Tool | Generated Config | Instruction File | Invocation |
|------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/commands/fk-<name>.md` (stubs) | `CLAUDE.md` (committed) | `/fk-<name>` |
| Codex CLI | — | `AGENTS.md` (generated) | Read `skills/fk-<name>.md` |

`agy` (Antigravity) is not a target here: it expands neither `.gemini/commands/*.toml`
nor `.claude/commands/*.md`, and does not auto-load `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md` or
`CLAUDE.md` in print mode. It is supported as a **video-review provider**
instead — see `/fk-change-provider`.

**Adding a new skill:** Create `skills/fk-<name>.md`, then run `python setup.py sync`.

**Never hand-edit `AGENTS.md`** — it says so at the top and it means it. Rules
added there directly are deleted by the next `sync`. Put them in `setup.py`'s
`_CRITICAL_RULES` or `_PIPELINE_OVERVIEW` instead, which is where the file is
built from.

## Full Example: "Luna the Space Cat" (3 scenes, vertical)

This walkthrough shows exactly how an AI agent uses skills to go from idea to final video.

### 1. `/fk-create-project`

**Agent asks:** What's your project? Characters, locations, key objects, scenes, orientation?

**User says:** "Luna is a small white cat astronaut exploring a candy planet. 3 scenes: she lands on the planet, discovers a chocolate river, and plants a flag on a gummy bear mountain. Vertical, Pixar 3D."

**Agent thinks:** Break the story into visual elements that repeat across scenes:

| Element | entity_type | Why it needs a reference | description (appearance only) |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Luna | `character` | Main character in all 3 scenes | Small white cat with big blue eyes, wearing a tiny orange space suit with a round glass helmet. Fluffy tail sticking out. Pixar-style 3D. |
| Candy Planet Surface | `location` | Ground/environment in all scenes | Alien planet surface made of colorful hard candies, lollipop trees, cotton candy clouds, pastel pink and purple sky. Pixar-style 3D. |
| Chocolate River | `location` | Key location in scene 2 | Wide flowing river of dark melted chocolate with marshmallow rocks along the banks, steam rising, rich brown tones. Pixar-style 3D. |
| Gummy Bear Mountain | `location` | Key location in scene 3 | Tall mountain made of giant translucent gummy bears stacked together, glowing from inside, rainbow colors. Pixar-style 3D. |

**Agent writes scene prompts** (action + environment, NO character appearance):

| Scene | Prompt | character_names | Chain |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | "Luna steps out of a small rocket onto Candy Planet Surface. First footprint in candy dust. Wide shot, dramatic landing moment. Pixar 3D, cinematic." | Luna, Candy Planet Surface | ROOT |
| 2 | "Luna kneels at the edge of Chocolate River on Candy Planet Surface, dipping a paw in. Surprised expression, licking the paw. Warm lighting reflected off chocolate. Pixar 3D." | Luna, Candy Planet Surface, Chocolate River | CONTINUATION ← 1 |
| 3 | "Luna plants a small flag on top of Gummy Bear Mountain, triumphant pose. Candy Planet Surface stretching to the horizon below. Epic wide angle, sunset glow through gummy bears. Pixar 3D." | Luna, Candy Planet Surface, Gummy Bear Mountain | CONTINUATION ← 2 |

**Agent executes:**

### Result

A 24-second Pixar-style video of Luna the Space Cat:
- **Scene 1:** Luna lands on the candy planet (8s)
- **Scene 2:** Luna discovers the chocolate river and tastes it (8s)
- **Scene 3:** Luna plants a flag on gummy bear mountain at sunset (8s)

Luna looks the same across all 3 scenes because her reference image was used as `imageInputs` in every scene generation. The candy planet surface is consistent too — same colors, same lollipop trees, same sky.

---

### What the agent needed to know

1. **Break story into visual elements** → characters, locations, assets (with `entity_type`)
2. **Description = appearance only** → what it looks like, not what it does
3. **Scene prompt = action only** → what happens, reference entities by name
4. **`character_names` = which refs to use** → list every entity visible in that scene
5. **Pipeline order** → refs MUST complete before images, images before videos
6. **One request at a time** → 10s cooldown, wait for COMPLETED before next
