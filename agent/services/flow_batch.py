"""Flow's batchexecute API — the transport Flow moved to in September 2026.

The old world was a REST call to ``aisandbox-pa.googleapis.com`` carrying a
``Bearer ya29.…`` the extension sniffed off the page. That token no longer
exists: the rewritten frontend on ``flow.google.com`` signs every call with the
session cookie plus a per-page ``at`` token, against a single batchexecute
endpoint. Nothing can be replayed from outside the browser — a generate call
also carries a **single-use** reCAPTCHA token, and a replayed one comes back
``PUBLIC_ERROR_UNUSUAL_ACTIVITY``.

So this module never touches the network. It builds request envelopes and reads
responses; issuing the request is the job of the Chrome extension, which runs
the payload inside the Flow tab (see ``FlowClient.batch_rpc``).

The wire format is Google's usual batchexecute:

    f.req = [[[rpcid, "<inner payload as a JSON string>", null, "generic"]]]

and the response is a ``)]}'`` sentinel followed by length-prefixed chunks of
``["wrb.fr", rpcid, "<payload as a JSON string>", …]`` envelopes.

Ported from postforge/bridges/flowgen/flow_batch.py — see its MIGRATION.md for
the traps behind each of the comments below.
