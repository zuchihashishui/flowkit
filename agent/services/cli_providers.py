"""What each AI CLI accepts, and which one a given role runs on.

Three CLIs back the vision work: Claude Code (`claude`), Google Antigravity
(`agy`) and OpenAI Codex (`codex`). They disagree about almost everything —
flag names, effort ladders, whether an unknown model slug is an error — so the
differences live here rather than being re-derived at each call site.

Config lives in `agent/providers.json`, hot-reloaded into `config.CLI_PROVIDERS`:

    {"active": "claude",
     "roles": {"video_review": {"provider": "agy", "model": null, "effort": "low"}}}

`active` predates `roles` and is still the fallback for any role without an
entry, so an old providers.json keeps working untouched.
