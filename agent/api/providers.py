"""CLI provider config API — which AI CLI, model and effort each role runs on.

`active` is the legacy single-provider switch; `roles` is the per-role
configuration the dashboard edits. Every write here keeps the two consistent,
so neither reader sees a stale answer.

The only real consumer of `active` is `skills/fk-change-provider.md`
(`scripts/statusline.sh` does not read it — its `active` matches are the
unrelated `/api/active-project`). One reader is reason enough to keep the
field in step; it is not reason to grow more of them.
