# Flow Kit

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8100`

## Pre-flight

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/health
# Must return: {"extension_connected": true}

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/flow/status
# Must return: {"transport": "batch", "flow_project_id": "<uuid>", ...}
```

Also needed: **one signed-in `https://flow.google.com/` tab left open**. Only the
page can sign a Flow request, so nothing works headless.

## How to work

- Always use `/fk-*` skills — all rules and workflows live inside each skill
- Never write scripts to loop API calls — use `POST /api/requests/batch`
- `media_id` is always UUID format (`xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`), never `CAMS...` strings
- **On any pipeline error** (request `FAILED`, stuck `PROCESSING`, `extension_connected: false`, HTTP 4xx/5xx from `:8100`, YouTube `HttpError`, error strings like `UNSAFE_GENERATION` / `not found` / `CAPTCHA` / `NO_AT_TOKEN` / `NO_FLOW_PROJECT` / `UNSUPPORTED_ON_BATCH_API`): invoke `/fk-doctor` before guessing a fix
- `flow_key_present: false` is **normal** — the current transport has no bearer token

## Since Flow moved (September 2026)

Flow lives at `flow.google.com` and signs every call in the page. Consequences
that change how you work:

- **Projects are not created by Flow Kit any more.** Make one in the Flow UI and
  pin its uuid as `FLOW_PROJECT_ID`, or pass `flow_project_id` to `POST /api/projects`.
- **Three capabilities are unported**, all on the Veo path, because their
  payloads were never captured: **video** upscale (not image export, which
  works), Veo r2v, and Veo start+end-frame chaining. They fail with
  `UNSUPPORTED_ON_BATCH_API` rather than silently producing the wrong thing.
  Omni covers frame, first+last and reference modes — use
  `model_family=omni_flash`. `FLOW_ALLOW_DEGRADED=1` drops Veo chaining and r2v
  to plain i2v; video upscale has no fallback. See `docs/CAPTURE.md`.
- **A poll saying "Media not found." is not a failure.** Finished jobs report it.
